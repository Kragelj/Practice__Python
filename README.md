# Practice Cases and Mini Projects Repository

Learning data analysis is an exciting adventure filled with curiosity, late-night debugging, and the thrill of making sense of raw data.

This repository is a reflection of my **self-learning journey**, powered by **Data Analysis Camp - Alex the Analyst** (mostly through YouTube and his website) and **Iron Hack bootcamp** materials available on GitHub.

I also strengthened my skills through hands-on practice with different programs like Tableau Public, and Power BI. I was focusing on data visualization, exploring various ways to present insights effectively, from interactive dashboards in Tableau to creating compelling charts and graphs with Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python.
Additionally, I practiced on platforms like HackerRank, SQL Bolt, and other interactive learning sites, tackling challenges that deepened my understanding of SQL and problem-solving techniques, while extensively working with MySQL Workbench to manage databases, execute queries, and refine my SQL expertise.

Here, youâ€™ll find a collection of my practice cases and mini-projects, covering everything from **data cleaning and exploratory analysis** to **visualizations, web scraping, statistics**, and other essential techniques in **Python**.
Whether it's organizing messy datasets, uncovering insights, or scraping the web for useful information, this repo showcases my progress in mastering the essential skills for **data-driven problem solving**.

## Contents

This repository includes:
- **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Handling missing values, duplicates, formatting, and transformations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating data distributions, correlations, and visual patterns.
- **Visualization**: Creating graphs and plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Small Projects**:  
  - BMI Calculator  
  - Automatic File Sorter  
  - Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup  

## Techniques Covered

### Data Handling
- Reading different file types (`csv`, `xlsx`, etc.)
- Dropping duplicates and columns
- Applying transformations (`strip`, `replace`, `split`)
- Handling missing values (`fillna`, `isnull`)
- Indexing (`loc`, `iloc`)

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Sorting and grouping (`groupby`, `sort_values`)
- Statistical insights (`correlation`, `heatmap`, `unique values`)
- Transposing and formatting (`dtypes`, `float format`)
- Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn (`heatmap`, `plots`)

### Web Scraping
- Connecting to websites & extracting data (`BeautifulSoup`)
- Using methods like `find`, `find_all`, `strip`
- Exporting the extracted data

### Machine Learning Basics
- Sampling and training datasets (`sample`, `train dataset`, `test dataset`)
- Model fitting and predictions (`fitting`, `predict`)
